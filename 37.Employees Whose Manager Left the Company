SELECT a.employee_id
FROM (
      SELECT *
      FROM Employees 
      WHERE salary < 30000 AND manager_id is NOT NULL
     ) AS a 
LEFT JOIN Employees AS b ON a.manager_id = b.employee_id
WHERE b.employee_id IS NULL
ORDER BY a.employee_id;

Note: Whose manager left the company
需要注意where语句的使用
注意审题思考就好啦。问题不大的。
