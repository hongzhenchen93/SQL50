SELECT IFNULL((SELECT DISTINCT salary 
               FROM Employee 
               ORDER BY salary DESC
               LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1), NULL) AS SecondHighestSalary;

Note:
In MySQL, LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1 is used to retrieve the second row from a queryâ€™s result set.
How it works:
OFFSET 1: Skips the first row in the result set
LIMIT 1:Returns only 1 row after skipping the offset
