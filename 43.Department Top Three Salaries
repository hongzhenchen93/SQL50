SELECT d1.name AS Department, e1.name AS Employee, e1.salary AS salary
FROM Employee AS e1
INNER JOIN Department AS d1 ON d1.id = e1.departmentId 
WHERE (
       SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT e2.salary)
       FROM Employee AS e2
       WHERE e2.salary > e1.salary AND e2.departmentId = e1.departmentId
      ) < 3;

Note:思路为公司里前3高的薪水意味着不超过3个工资比这些值大。
